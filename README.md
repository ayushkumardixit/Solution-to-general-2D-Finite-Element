# Solution-to-general-2D-Finite-Element
The codes are capable of solving any 2D problem with multiple elements using 3 Noded triangular, 4 Noded quadrialteral, 8 Noded quadrilateral and 6 Noded triangular discretization method. The method uses guass quadratur integartion method and is really close to exact solutions.
